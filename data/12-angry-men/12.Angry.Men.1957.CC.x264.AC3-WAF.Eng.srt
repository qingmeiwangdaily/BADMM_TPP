
56
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,353
#5
I never knew they locked the door.

57
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,605
#10
Sure they lock the door.
What'd you think?

58
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,109
#5
I don't know.
It just never occurred to me.

59
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,529
#10
What's that for?

60
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,489
#0
Oh, I thought we might want
to vote by ballot.

61
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,242
#10
Great idea. Maybe we can
get him elected senator.


64
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,877
#3
- Ηow'd you like it?
- Oh, I don't know.

65
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,628
#2
It was pretty interesting.

66
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,672
#3
Yeah? I almost fell asleep.

67
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,341
#2
I mean, I've never been
on a jury before.

68
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,136
#3
No? I've sat on many juries.

69
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,223
#3
What gets me is the way
those lawyers talk and talk and talk...

70
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,476
#3
even when it's an open-and-shut case
like this one.

71
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,269
#3
Did you ever hear
so much talk about nothin'?

72
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,229
#2
Well, I guess they're entitled.

73
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,774
#3
Yeah. They're entitled.
It's the system, but -

74
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:45,071
#3
If you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids down
before they start any trouble.

75
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,239
#3
It would save us a lot of time and money.

76
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,866
#7
- Hey, let's get started, huh?

77
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,577
#3
Yeah, let's get goin', huh?
We probably all got things to do here.

78
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,705
#0
I figured we'd start out with a five-minute break.
There's one gentleman in the bathroom.

00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,626
#5
- Are, uh - Are we gonna sit in order?


81
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,461
#0
I, uh - Well, I guess so.


84
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,307
#12
Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?

85
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,396
#12
What did you think of the case?

86
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,524
#12
I mean, it had a lot of interest for me.

87
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,735
#12
No real... dead spots.
You know what I mean?

88
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,072
#12
I tell you, we were lucky
to get a murder case.

89
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,116
#12
I figured us for an assault or burglary.

90
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,451
#12
Boy, they can be the dullest.


93
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,997
#12
That the Woolworth Building?

94
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,999
#8
That's right.


96
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,129
#12
You know, I've lived here all my life.
I've never been inside that.

99
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,553
#7
Yeah. You can say that again.
And what about that business with the knife?

100
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,514
#7
I mean, asking grown-up people
to believe that kind of jazz, huh?

101
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,058
#10
Well, I expected that.
You know what we're dealing with.

102
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,602
#7
Yeah, I guess so.


105
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,524
#7
What do you got, a cold?


106
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,818
#10
These hot-weather colds can kill you.

107
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,320
#10
I can hardly touch my nose.
You know what I mean?

108
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,949
#7
I sure do. I just got over one.

109
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,785
- Aw, come on. Mr. Foreman, let's go here, huh?
- [ Snapping Fingers ]

110
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,495
Well, that guy's still in the bathroom.

111
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,415
Hey, what's new? I didn't get a chance
to see a paper this morning.

112
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,583
Hmm?

113
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,085
I was only wondering
how the market closed.

114
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,880
You got a seat on the Exchange?

115
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,715
I'm a broker.

116
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:32,178
I run a messenger service -
the Beck and Call Company.

117
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,388
The name is my wife's idea.

118
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,100
Got 37 men working.
Started with nothing.

119
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:41,353
Okay, men, let's take our seats, huh?

120
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,440
[ Chattering ]

121
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,358
Yeah, we can all get outta here
pretty quick, huh?

122
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,653
I don't know about the rest of you, but I happen
to have tickets to that ball game tonight.

123
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,572
Yanks and Cleveland.

124
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,449
Yeah, we got this kid,
Modjelewski, in there.

125
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,201
Ooh, he's a real bull, this kid.

126
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,411
You know - Phoom!

127
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,747
A real jug handle. You know?

128
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,082
Phoom!

129
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,501
You're a real baseball fan, aren't you?
Huh? Yeah.

130
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,045
Where do we sit here?

131
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,215
Well, I thought we'd sit in order,
you know, by jury numbers.

132
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,717
One, two, three, four, five -
so on, around the table.

133
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,052
If that's okay with you gentlemen.

134
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,220
- Sure.
- What's the difference?

135
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,348
- I think it's reasonable to sit in order.
- Let it be.

136
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,683
- Number 12. Do I sit down here?
- Yeah. That's 12. We go around -

137
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,020
- We start with you. One, right?
- One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.

138
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,439
What was your impression
of the prosecuting attorney?

139
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,233
Okay. Two. You're two.

140
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,484
I beg pardon?

141
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,738
I thought he was really sharp, the way
he handled all those points one by one.

142
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,950
Logical sequence.
I was very impressed.

143
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,036
I think he - he did an expert job.

144
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,122
A lot of drive too, you know?
Real drive.

145
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,291
- Okay, fellas, can we hold it down a minute?
- Sure.

146
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,960
- Uh, fellas.
- [ Taps On Table ]

147
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,505
Say, we'd like to get started.
Gentleman at the window.

148
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,342
- We'd like to get started.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

149
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:57,096
Pretty tough to figure, isn't it?
Kid kills his father - bing, just like that.

150
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,765
Aw, listen, you analyze the figures,
you'll see it happens all the time.

151
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,767
They let those kids
run wild up there.

152
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,561
Well, maybe it serves 'em right.
You know what I mean?

153
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,230
Is - Is everyone here?

154
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,148
The old man is inside.

155
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,859
Oh. Would you, uh,
knock on the door for him?

156
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,903
You a Yankee fan?

157
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,530
No. Baltimore.

158
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,949
- Baltimore?
- Yeah.

159
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,786
That's like being hit in the head
with a crowbar once a day.

160
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,454
[ Chuckles ]

161
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,789
Who have they got?

162
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,292
No, I mean, who have they got
besides good groundskeepers?

163
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,918
[ Foreman ]
Say, uh, we'd like to get started.

164
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,046
Oh, forgive me, gentlemen.
I - I didn't mean to keep you waiting.

165
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,632
Baltimore?

166
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,510
Okay, gentlemen,
if I can have your attention.

167
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,555
You fellas can handle this thing
any way that you want to.

168
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,141
I'm, um - You know,
I'm not gonna make any rules.

169
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,519
Uh, we can, well, discuss it first
and, uh, then vote on it.

170
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,272
That's, of course, uh -
That's, uh, one way.

171
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,317
And, uh, well, we can
vote on it right now, and -

172
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,902
I think it's customary
to take a preliminary vote.

173
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,573
Yeah, let's - Let's vote. Who knows?
Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?

174
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,366
Uh-huh.

175
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,536
Okay, then I think that, uh -

176
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,497
Of course you know that we have
a first-degree murder charge here...

177
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,666
and if we vote the accused guilty...

178
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:11,003
uh, we've got to send him
to the chair.

179
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,840
- Um, that's mandatory.
- I think we know that.

180
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,675
- Let's see who's where.
- We might as well.

181
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,554
- Okay. Uh, anyone doesn't want to vote?
- All right with me.

182
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:26,352
Okay. Then, uh, just remember
that this has to be 12 to nothing either way.

183
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,895
Um, that's the law.

184
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,022
Okay, are we ready?

185
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,108
Now, all those voting guilty,
please raise your hands.

186

One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

eight, nine, 10, 11.

188
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,539
Okay. That's 11 guilty.

189
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,124
Those voting not guilty.

190
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,378
One. Right.

191
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,755
That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.

192
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,257
Well, now we know where we are.

193
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:01,512
Boy, oh, boy. There's always one.
[ Laughing ]

So, what do we do now?

195
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,266
Well, I guess we talk.

196
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,684
Boy, oh, boy.

197
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,603
You really think he's innocent?

198
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,608
I don't know.

199
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,569
I mean, you sat in court with the rest of us.
You heard what we did.

200
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,780
The kid's a dangerous killer.
You could see it.

201
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,490
He's 18 years old.

202
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,659
Well, that's old enough. Ηe -

203
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,412
He stabbed his own father
four inches into the chest.

204
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,747
They proved it
a dozen different ways in court.

205
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,375
Would you like me to list them for you?

206
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,751
No.

207
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,920
Then what do you want?

208
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,923
- I just want to talk.
- What's there to talk about?

209
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,341
Eleven men in here think he's guilty.

210
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,677
No one had to think about it twice
except you.

211
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,972
I want to ask you something.
Do you believe his story?

212
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,766
I don't know whether I believe it or not.
Maybe I don't.

213
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,435
So how come you vote not guilty?

214
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,437
Well, there were 11 votes for guilty.

215
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,273
It's not easy to raise my hand
and send a boy off to die...

216
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,442
without talking about it first.

217
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,944
- Well, now, who says it's easy?
- No one.

218
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,406
What, just because I voted fast?

219
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,908
I honestly think the guy's guilty.

220
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,786
You couldn't change my mind
if you talked for a hundred years.

221
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,872
I'm not trying to change your mind.
It's just that -

222
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,708
We're talking about somebody's life here.

223
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,877
We can't decide it in five minutes.
Supposing we're wrong.

224
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,378
"Supposing we're wrong."

225
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,464
Supposing this whole building
should fall down on my head.

226
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,549
- You can suppose anything.
- That's right.

227
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,135
Look, what's the difference
how long it takes?

228
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,804
Suppose we do it in five minutes.
So what?

229
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,015
Let's take an hour.

230
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,017
The ball game doesn't start till 8:00.

231
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,896
Hmm?

232
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,900
Who's got something to say?

233
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,401
I'm willing to sit for an hour.

234
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,196
Great. I heard
a pretty good story last night.

235
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,364
That's not why we're sitting here.

236
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,619
All right, then you tell me.
What are we sitting here for?

237
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,705
I don't know. Maybe no reason.

238
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:56,168
Look, this kid's been kicked around
all of his life -

239
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:00,172
you know, born in a slum,
mother dead since he was nine.

240
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,466
He lived for a year and a half
in an orphanage when his -

241
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,469
his father was serving a jail term
for forgery.

242
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,888
It's not a very happy beginning.

243
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,098
He's a - a wild, angry kid.

244
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,892
That's all he's ever been.
And you know why?

245
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,687
'Cause he's been hit on the head by somebody
once a day every day.

246
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,981
He's had a -
He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.

247
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,026
I - I just think we owe him a few words.
That's all.

248
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,655
I don't mind telling you this, mister.
We don't owe him a thing.

249
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,824
He got a fair trial, didn't he?
What do you think that trial cost?

250
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,994
- He's lucky he got it. You know what I mean?
- [ Juror 7 ] You know it.

251
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,413
Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.

252
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,374
We heard the facts, didn't we?

253
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,253
You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed
to believe this kid, knowing what he is.

254
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,713
Listen, I've lived among them
all my life.

255
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,133
You can't believe a word they say.
You know that.

256
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,052
I mean, they're born liars.

257
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,472
- Only an ignorant man can believe that.
- Now listen -

258
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,392
Do you think you were born
with a monopoly on the truth?

259
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,061
I think certain things should be
pointed out to this man.

260
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,230
[ Juror 7 ] Come on. This isn't Sunday.
We don't need a sermon.

261
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,566
[ Foreman ] Come on.
We have a job to do. Now let's do it.

262
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,653
Rice Pops.
It's a product I work on at the agency.

263
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,115
"The breakfast with the built-in bounce."

264
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,825
- I wrote that line.
- Very catchy.

265
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,077
- Yeah.
- Say, do you mind?

266
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,870
Oh, I'm sorry.

267
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,415
I have this habit of doodling.
Keeps me thinking clearly.

268
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,208
Yeah, we have all this work to do.

269
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,002
- There's no point staying here forever.
- Sorry.

270
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,296
Okay. Um...

271
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,174
perhaps if the gentleman down there
who's disagreeing with us -

272
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,553
Well, perhaps you could tell us why.
You know, let us know what you're thinking.

273
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,014
And we might be able to show you
where you're mixed up.

274
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,765
Well, look, maybe -
Maybe this is an idea.

275
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,268
Now, I haven't given it much thought,
but it seems to me...

276
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:40,772
that it's up to the group of us to convince
this gentleman that he's wrong and we're right.

277
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,400
Now, maybe if we each took
a couple of minutes just to -

278
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,236
Well, it was just a quick idea.

279
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,779
No, no, no. That's a good one.

280
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,949
Uh, suppose we go
once around the table.

281
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,910
- I guess you're first.
- Oh.

282
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,329
Well, uh -

283
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,291
Well, it-it's hard to put into words.

284
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,336
I just think he's guilty.

285
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,921
I thought it was obvious
from the word "go."

286
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,506
I mean, nobody proved otherwise.

287
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,133
Nobody has to prove otherwise.

288
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,469
The burden of proof's on the prosecution.

289
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,013
The defendant doesn't even
have to open his mouth.

290
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,224
- That's in the Constitution.
- Oh, well, sure, I know that.

291
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,268
Uh, what I meant was, is -

292
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,064
Well, I just think he's guilty.

293
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,857
I-I mean, somebody saw him do it.

294
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:28,987
Okay. Uh, here's what I think,
and I have no personal feelings about this.

295
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,239
I just want to talk about facts.

296
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,368
- Number one.
- [ Notebook Rustles ]

297
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:39,039
The old man lived downstairs under the room
where the killing took place.

298
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,249
At 10 minutes after 12:00
on the night of the killing...

299
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,003
he heard loud noises,
said it sounded like a fight.

300
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,964
And he heard the kid yell out,
"I'm gonna kill ya."

301
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,342
A second later,
he heard a body hit the floor.

302
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,135
Ran to the door, opened it up...

303
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,638
saw the kid running down the stairs
and out of the house.

304
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,014
Called the police.

305
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,767
They came in,
found the old man with a knife in his chest.

306
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,104
The coroner fixed the time of death
around midnight.

307
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,273
Now these are facts.
You can't refute facts.

308
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,526
The kid is guilty.

309
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,611
I'm just as sentimental as the next fella.

310
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,573
I know he's only 18, but he's still
gotta pay for what he did.

311
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,117
[ Juror 7 ]
I'm with you.

312
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,744
[ Foreman ]
Okay. Are you finished?

313
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,287
- Yeah.
- Right. Next.

314
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,582
It is obvious, to me anyway,
that the boy's entire story was flimsy.

315
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,876
He claimed he was at the movies
during the time of the killing...

316
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,504
and yet, one hour later, he couldn't
remember the names of the films he saw...

317
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,423
- or who played in them.
- [ Juror 3 ] That's right.

318
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,800
And no one saw him going in
or out of the theater.

319
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,510
Listen, what about the woman
across the street?

320
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,887
If her testimony don't prove it,
nothing does.

321
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,306
That's right. She was the one
who actually saw the killing.

322
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,809
[ Foreman ] Now, fellas, please.
Let's go in order here, huh?

323
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,146
Just a minute. Here's a woman -
[ Coughing ]

324
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,690
Here's a woman who was lying in bed.
She can't sleep.

325
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,692
She's dying with the heat.
You know what I mean?

326
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,610
Anyway, she looks out the window...

327
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:54,281
and right across the street she sees
the kid stick the knife into his father.

328
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,242
[ Deep Breath ]
The time is 12:10 on the nose.

329
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,202
Everything fits.

330
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,121
Look, she's known the kid all his life.

331
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,331
His window is right opposite hers
across the el tracks...

332
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,083
and she swore she saw him do it.

333
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,836
- Through the windows of the passing el train.
- Right.

334
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,090
This el train had no passengers on it.
It was just being moved downtown.

335
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,093
The lights were out, remember?
And they proved in court that, at night...

336
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,596
you can look through the windows
of an el train when the lights are out...

337
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,015
and see what's happening
on the other side.

338
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,934
- They proved it.
- I'd like to ask you something.

339
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,687
You don't believe the boy's story.
How come you believe the woman's?

340
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,522
She's one of them too, isn't she?

341
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:32,194
You're a pretty smart fella, aren't you?

342
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,695
- Okay, gentlemen.
- Now, now.

343
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,989
- Now, gentlemen.
- Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

344
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,617
Oh, what's he so wise about?
I'm telling you.

345
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,953
[ Foreman ] Okay, now come on.
Now we're not gonna get anywhere fighting.

346
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,288
Whose turn is it next?

347
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,208
[ Juror 12 ]
Oh, uh, his. Number five.

348
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,213
Okay, may I - Can I pass? It -

349
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,049
Well, uh, that's your privilege.

350
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,260
Uh, how about the next gentleman?

351
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,013
Oh. Well, uh, I don't know.

352
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:04,309
I started to be convinced, you know,
very early in the case.

353
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:09,022
You see, I was looking for a motive.
That's very important.

354
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,318
Because if you don't have a motive,
where's your case, right?

355
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,488
Anyway, that, uh, testimony
from those people...

356
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,616
in the apartment across the hall
from the kid's apartment -

357
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,952
that was very powerful.

358
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,830
Didn't they say something about a -
a fight and an argument...

359
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:29,334
between the old man and his son
around about, uh, 7:00 that night?

360
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,878
- I mean, I could be wrong, but I -
- It was 8:00.

361
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,005
It was 8:00. That's right.
They heard an argument.

362
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,841
They couldn't hear what it was about.

363
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,884
Then they heard
the father hit the boy twice.

00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,929
- [ Coughing ]
- Finally they saw the boy
run angrily out of the house.

What does that prove?

366
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,351
Well, it don't exactly prove anything.
It's just part of the picture.

367
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,354
Well, you said it provided a motive.
The prosecuting attorney said the same thing.

368
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,690
I don't think
that was a very strong motive.

This boy's been hit so many times in his life
that violence is practically a -

It's a normal state of affairs with him.

I just - I can't see two slaps in the face
provoking him into committing murder.

372
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,787
It may have been two too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.

Anything else?

- No.
- Okay.

00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,796
Uh, how about you?

00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,592
I don't know. It's all been said.

377

You can talk here forever.
It's still the same thing.

378
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,933
This kid is five for 0.

379
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,894
Well, look at his record.

380
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,187
When he was 10,
he was in children's court.

381
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,064
He threw a rock at a teacher.

382

When he was 15, he was in reform school.

383
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,360
He stole a car.

He's been arrested for mugging.

385
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,032
He was picked up twice for knife fighting.

386

Oh, yeah, they say
he's real handy with a knife.

[ Scoffs ]
Oh, this is a very fine boy.

388

Ever since he was five years old,
his father beat him up regularly.

389
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,667
- He used his fists.
- Well, so would I.

A kid like that?
[ Scoffs ]

It's these kids, the way they are nowadays.

392

When I was a kid,
I used to call my father "sir."

393
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,221
That's right. "Sir."

394
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,265
Do you ever hear a kid
call his father that anymore?

[ Juror 8 ] Fathers don't seem to think
it's important anymore.

- Three.

[ Murmurs ]

400
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,535
When he was nine years old,
he ran away from a fight.

401
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,415
I saw it. I was so embarrassed
I almost threw up.

402
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:38,713
I said, "I'm gonna make a man out of you
if I have to break you in two trying."

403
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,134
Well, I made a man out of him.

404
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,304
When he was 16, we had a fight.

405
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,266
Hit me in the jaw.
He was a big kid.

406
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,772
Haven't seen him for two years.

Well, let's get going.

410
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,911
[ Juror 4 ]
I think we're missing the point here.

411
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,415
This boy, let's say he's the product
of a broken home and a filthy neighborhood.

412
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:17,085
We can't help that. We're here to decide
whether he's innocent or guilty...

413
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,088
not to go into the reasons
why he grew up the way he did.

414
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,882
He was born in a slum.
Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.

415
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,843
I know it, and so do you.

It's no secret children from slum backgrounds
are potential menaces to society.

- Now I think -
- Brother, you can say that again.

418
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,519
The kids who crawl out of these places
are real trash.

- Listen, mister. Listen.

- Wait a minute.

Please, I - I played in backyards
that were filled with garbage.

- Aw, come on, fella. He didn't mean you.

Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.

Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought
you were all gonna try to convince me.

to keep this thing organized?

You take on the responsibility.

According to the testimony,
the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

458

I sat there in court for six days
listening while the evidence built up.

Everybody sounded so positive, you know?

about this trial.

I mean, nothing is that positive.

462

There are a lot of questions
I'd have liked to ask.

I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't
have meant anything, but -

464
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,849
I began to get the feeling
that the defense counsel...

465
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,434
wasn't conducting a thorough-enough
cross-examination.

What little things? Listen,
when these fellas don't ask questions...

468
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,318
it's because they know the answers already
and they figure they'll be hurt.

Maybe it's also possible for a lawyer
to be just plain stupid, isn't it?

I'd have asked for another lawyer, I think.

I mean, if I was on trial for my life...

476
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:11,718
I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.

Look, there was one alleged eyewitness
to this killing.

Someone else claims he heard the killing,
saw the boy run out afterwards.

at 8:00 on the night of the murder...

by his father.

He said "punched."

between a slap and a punch.

by his father.

to a neighborhood junk shop...

516

- where he bought one of those -
- Switch knives.

This wasn't what you'd call

It had a very unusual carved handle
and blade.

The storekeeper who sold it to him...

said it was the only one of its kind
he had ever had in stock.

522

Three. He met some friends of his
in front of a tavern about 8:45.

leaving them at 9:45.

at about 11:30...

to find his father dead and himself arrested.

535
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,285
He also claims that
the two detectives who arrested him...

536
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,662
threw him down a half a flight of stairs.

Now, what happened to the switch knife?

He claims that it fell through a hole
in his pocket on the way to the movies...

I think it's quite clear that the boy
never went to the movies that night.

No one in the house
saw him go out at 11:30.

No one at the theater identified him.

00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,293
Has anyone here
ever lived near the el tracks?

806
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:48,005
Well, uh, I just finished painting an apartment
that overlooked an el line.

807
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,756
- I was there for three days.
- What was it like?

808
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,008
- What do you mean?
- Noisy?

809
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,635
Oh, brother. Don't matter though.
We were all punchy.

810
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,305
I lived in a second-floor apartment
near the el line once.

811
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,433
When the window was open and the train
goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.

812
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,352
- You can hardly hear yourself think.
- [ Juror 3 ]
All right, you can't hear yourself think.

813
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,855
- Will you get to the point?
- I will. Now just a minute.

814
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,567
Let's take two pieces of testimony
and try to put them together.

815
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:12,738
First. The old man in the apartment downstairs.

816
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,407
He says he heard the boy say
"I'm gonna kill you"...

817
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,243
and a split second later
heard a body hit the floor.

818
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:19,912
- One second later, right?
- [ Juror 2 ] That's right.

819
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:26,001
Second. The woman across the street swore
positively she looked out of the window...

820
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,421
and saw the killing through the last two cars
of the passing elevated train, right?

821
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,840
- The last two cars.
- [ Juror 3 ] What are you giving us here?

822
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:33,258
Now, just a minute.

823
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:37,763
We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds
for a train to pass a given point.

824
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,934
Since the woman saw the killing
through the last two cars...

825
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:46,980
we can assume that the body
hit the floor just as the train went by.

826
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:51,526
Therefore, the train had been roaring
by the old man's window...

827
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:55,113
a full 10 seconds
before the body hit the floor.

828
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,407
The old man,
according to his own testimony -

829
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,410
"I'm gonna kill you,"
body hitting the floor a split second later -

830
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,955
would have had to hear the boy
make this statement...

831
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,915
with the el roaring past his nose.

832
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,541
It's not possible he could've heard it.

833
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,794
- That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.
- Do you think he could've heard it?

834
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:11,255
He said he yelled at the top of his voice.
That's good enough for me.

835
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,590
Even if he heard something,
he still couldn't have identified the voice.

836
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:14,800
With the el roaring by?

837
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:17,261
You're talking about a matter of seconds!
Nobody can be that accurate.

838
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:21,974
I think testimony that could put a boy
into the electric chair should be that accurate.

839
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,101
[ Jurors Murmuring ]

840
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,103
You know something?
I don't think he could've heard it.

841
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,522
Maybe he didn't hear it.
I mean, with all that el noise.

842
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,482
[ Juror 3 ]
Oh, what are you people talking about?

843
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,609
[ Juror 5 ] Well, it stands to reason
he couldn't have heard it.

844
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,611
Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?

845
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,905
Attention maybe.

846
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,907
You keep coming in
with these bright sayings!

847
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:42,035
Why don't you send 'em in to a paper?
They pay three dollars apiece.

848
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,329
What are you talking to him
like that for?

849
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,709
Guy talks like that to an old man
really ought to get stepped on, you know?

850
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,627
You ought to have more respect, mister.

851
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,216
If you say stuff like that to him again,
I'm gonna lay you out.

852
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,146
Now you go ahead.
You - You say anything you like.

853
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:13,275
Why do you think
the old man might lie?

854
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,778
It was just that I looked at him
for a very long time.

855
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:20,657
The seams of his jacket was split,
under the shoulder.

856
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,326
Or did you notice that?

857
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,911
I mean, to come to court like that.

858
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,663
- Why -
- [ Juror 10 Coughs ]

859
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,668
He was a very old man
in a torn jacket.

860
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,629
And he walked very slowly
to the stand.

861
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:39,426
He was dragging his left leg
and trying to hide it -

862
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,178
because he was ashamed.

863
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,724
I think I know this man
better than anyone here.

864
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:52,022
This is a quiet, frightened,
insignificant old man who -

865
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,483
who has been nothing all his life...

866
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,985
who has never had recognition...

867
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,154
or his name in the newspapers.

868
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,032
Nobody knows him.

869
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,159
Nobody quotes him.

870
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:08,205
Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.

871
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,918
Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing -
to be nothing.

872
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:17,964
A man like this needs to be quoted,
to be listened to.

873
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,550
To be quoted just once.

874
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,511
Very important to him.

875
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,430
It would be so hard for him
to recede into the background -

876
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:27,224
- [ Juror 7 ] Wait a minute.
- When there was a chance -

877
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:30,185
What are you trying to do - tell us he'd lie
just so he could be important once?

878
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,896
No. He wouldn't really lie.

879
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,441
But perhaps he made himself believe
he heard those words...

880
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,735
and recognized the boy's face.

881
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,113
That's the most fantastic story
I've ever heard.

882
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:44,241
How can you make up a thing like that?
What do you know about it?

883
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,335
Oh, uh, does anybody
want a cough drop?

884
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,671
- [ Juror 12 ] No, thanks.
- [ Juror 8 ] I'll take one.

885
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:01,258
[ Juror 12 ] You can say what you like. I still
don't see how anybody can think he's not guilty.

886
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,844
There's something else
I'd like to talk about for a minute.

887
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,554
Thanks.

888
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:08,932
I think we've proved that the old man couldn't
have heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you."

889
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,600
- But supposing -
- You didn't prove it at all.

890
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:13,478
- What are you talking about?
- Supposing he really did hear it.

891
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:15,981
This phrase, how many times
have all of us used it?

892
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,566
Probably thousands.

893
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,276
"I could kill you for that, darling."

894
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,278
"Junior, you do that once more,
and I'm gonna kill you."

895
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:22,654
"Get in there, Rocky, and kill him."

896
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,614
We say it every day. That doesn't mean
we're really gonna kill anybody.

897
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,491
Wait a minute.
What are you trying to give us here?

898
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:30,287
The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you."
The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.

899
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,705
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.

900
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,082
Anybody says a thing like that
the way he said it, they mean it.

901
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:35,625
Well, gee, now I don't know.

902
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:40,422
I remember I was arguing with a guy
I work next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.

903
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,257
He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.

904
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,302
Now listen! This guy's trying to make you
believe things that aren't so.

905
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,471
The kid said he was gonna kill him,
and he did kill him.

906
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,515
Let me ask you this. Do you really think
the boy would shout out a thing like that...

907
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,392
so the whole neighborhood could hear him?

908
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:54,311
I don't think so.
He's much too bright for that.

909
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:59,149
Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.
He don't even speak good English.

910
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,068
"He doesn't even speak good English."

911
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,325
Mr. Foreman, I'd like
to change my vote to not guilty.

912
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,826
You what?

913
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:12,329
- You heard me.
- [ Foreman ] Are you sure?

914
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,664
Yeah, I'm sure.

915
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,209
The vote is nine to three,
favor of guilty.

916
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,086
Well, if this isn't the living end. Huh?

917
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,885
What are you basing it on -
the stories this guy made up?

918
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,846
You ought to write for one of those
kooky detective magazines.

919
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,765
You'd make a fortune.

920
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,268
For crying out loud. The kid's own lawyer
knew he didn't stand a chance.

921
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,354
Right from the beginning,
his own lawyer knew it.

922
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,231
You could see it.

923
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,901
Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you,
this guy here is really something.

924
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,529
Look, the kid had a lawyer, didn't he?

925
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:48,448
He presented his case, not you.
How come you got so much to say?

926
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,368
- Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.
- Baltimore, please. Huh?

927
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,161
He was court-appointed.

928
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:55,080
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It could mean a lot of things.

929
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:58,416
It could mean he didn't want the case,
or he resented being appointed.

930
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,335
It's the kind of case
that brings him nothing -

931
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,380
no money, no glory,
not even much chance of winning.

932
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:06,383
That's not a very promising situation
for a young lawyer.

933
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:09,386
He'd really have to believe in his client
to put up any kind of a good case...

934
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,471
and, as you pointed out a minute ago,
obviously he didn't.

935
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,391
Of course he didn't. Huh.

936
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:16,768
Who the heck could?

937
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,771
Except maybe
some guy's mother or somebody. I -

938
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,107
Ah, look.
Will you look at the time, huh?

939
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:24,734
- Come on. For crying out -
- Pardon me.

940
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,153
- I have made some notes here -
- Notes.

941
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,864
and I would like to -
please, to say something.

942
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,200
- Yeah.
- I have been listening very carefully.

943
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:36,705
And, uh, it seems to me that this man
has some very good points to make.

944
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:41,418
From what was presented at the trial,
the boy looks guilty on the surface.

945
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:45,589
- But maybe if we go deeper?
- Oh, come on, will ya?

946
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,966
There is a question I would like to ask.

947
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,344
Let us assume that the boy
really did commit the murder.

948
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:54,764
Now, this happened
at 10 minutes after 12:00.

949
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,309
Now, how was he caught by the police?

950
00:48:57,393 --> 00:49:01,896
He came back home, uh, at 3:00 or so...

951
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:05,734
and he was captured by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

952
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:10,405
Now, my question is,
if he really had killed his father...

953
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,700
why would he come back home
three hours later?

954
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,661
Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?

955
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:18,496
He came home to get his knife.

956
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,124
It's not nice to go around leaving knives
sticking in people's chests.

957
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,960
- Yeah, especially relatives.
- Yeah. [ Giggling ]

958
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:26,296
[ Juror 4 ]
I don't see anything funny about it.

959
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,924
The boy knew the knife could be identified
as the one he had just bought.

960
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,177
He had to get it before the police did.

961
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:36,723
But if he knew the knife could be identified,
why did he leave it there in the first place?

962
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:40,143
Well, I think we can assume
the boy ran out in a state of panic...

963
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,604
after having just killed his father.

964
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,649
When he finally calmed down,
he realized he had left his knife there.

965
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,652
Ah. This then depends
on your definition of panic.

966
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:51,112
He would have had to be
calm enough to see to it...

967
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,782
that there were no fingerprints
left on the knife.

968
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:57,911
Now, where did this panic start
and where did it end?

969
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,372
Look, you voted guilty.
What side are ya on?

970
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:04,000
I don't believe I have to be loyal
to one side or the other.

971
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,877
I'm simply asking questions.

972
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,963
Well, this is just off the top of my head,
but, uh...

973
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,549
well, if I were the boy
and I'd done the stabbing and everything...

974
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,760
I'd take a chance
and go back for the knife.

975
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,346
I'll bet he figured that nobody
had seen him running out...

976
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,932
and that the body wouldn't be discovered
till the next day.

977
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,059
Well, after all,
it was the middle of the night.

978
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,645
I'll bet he'd figured nobody
would find the body till the next day.

979
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,730
Pardon. This is my whole point.

980
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:29,526
The woman across the street testified
that the moment after she saw the killing -

981
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,195
that is, a moment
after the train went by...

982
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,281
she screamed
and then went to telephone the police.

983
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,743
Now, the boy certainly
must have heard the scream...

984
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:42,330
so he knew
that somebody saw something.

985
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:45,208
I just don't think
that he would have gone back.

986
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,044
Two things. One, in his state of panic,
he may not have heard the scream.

987
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,796
Perhaps it wasn't very loud.

988
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,258
Two, if he did hear it, he may not
have connected it with his own act.

989
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:56,386
Remember, he lived in a neighborhood
where screams were fairly commonplace.

990
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,930
- There's your answer.
- Maybe.

991
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,891
Maybe the boy did kill his father,
didn't hear the scream...

992
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:05,687
did run out in a panic,
did calm down three hours later...

993
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,398
and come back to get the knife,
risking being caught by the police.

994
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,401
Maybe all of those things happened,
but maybe they didn't.

995
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,237
I think there's enough doubt that we can
wonder whether he was there at all...

996
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,989
during the time the killing took place.

997
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,824
What do you mean doubt?
What are you talking about?

998
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,617
Didn't the old man see him
running out of the house?

999
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:21,494
He's twisting the facts, I'm telling you.

1000
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:24,914
Did or didn't the old man see the kid
running out of the house at 12:10?

1001
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,916
Well, did or didn't he?

1002
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,211
- He says he did.
- "Says he did"? Boy! How do you like that?

1003
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:33,256
- Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.
- Sure, when you want them to, they do.

1004
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,592
Or when he wants them to, they do.
You know what I mean?

1005
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,510
- Keep the yelling down!
- Oh, you keep saying that.

1006
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,304
Maybe what we need
is a little yelling in here.

1007
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:41,097
These guys
keep going off every which way.

1008
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:43,099
Did hear the scream.
Didn't hear the scream.

1009
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:46,352
What difference does it make? You people
are talking only about the little details.

1010
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,938
You're forgetting the important stuff.
I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here -

1011
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,399
- I want to call for another vote.
- I'm talking here!

1012
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:55,153
There's another vote called for.
Now let's take our seats.

1013
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,576
I never saw so much time
spent on nothing.

1014
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,369
It only takes a second.

1015
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:07,874
[ Foreman ] Okay. I guess the fastest way
is to find out who's voting not guilty.

1016
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,710
Now, all those voting not guilty,
please raise your hands.

1017
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,548
Still the same.
One, two, three not guilty. Nine guilty.

1018
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,300
[ Juror 7 ]
So, now where are we?

1019
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,804
I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until
next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?

1020
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:23,640
Pardon. I vote not guilty.

1021
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,726
- Oh!
- [ Grumbling, Chattering ]

1022
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:30,104
What are ya talking about? I mean,
we're all going crazy in here or something.

1023
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,983
The kid is guilty.
Why don't you listen to the facts?

1024
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:36,319
Tell him, will ya?
Now this is getting to be a joke.

1025
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,614
[ Foreman ] The vote is eight to four,
favor of guilty.

1026
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:43,368
What is this, love your underprivileged
brother week or something?

1027
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,954
I want you to get up and tell me
why you changed your vote.

1028
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:50,333
- Come on. Give me your reasons.
- I don't have to defend my decision to you.

1029
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,168
There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.

1030
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:55,255
What reasonable doubt?
That's nothing but words. Here, look at this.

1031
00:52:55,339 --> 00:53:00,260
The kid you just decided isn't guilty
was seen ramming this into his father.

1032
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,345
Now, what about this,
Mr. Reasonable Doubt?

1033
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,098
That's not the knife.
Don't you remember?

1034
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,350
Oh, brilliant.

1035
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,727
I'm telling ya, this is the craziest.

1036
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,980
I mean, what are we supposed to believe?

1037
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:14,899
I mean, you're sittin' here,
you're pulling stories out of thin air, you know?

1038
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:18,695
A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting ringside
at the Dempsey-Firpo fight...

1039
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:21,239
he'd be trying to tell you that, uh -

1040
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,700
Look. Now, what about the old man?

1041
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,369
Are we supposed to believe
that he didn't get up and run to his door...

1042
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,455
and see the kid tearing down the steps
15 seconds after the killing?

1043
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,000
He's just saying so to be important, right?
[ Chuckles ]

1044
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:34,878
- I mean, what's the point of the whole thing?
- Wait. Hold it a second, will you?

1045
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,171
Oh, and the Baltimore rooter
is heard from again now...

1046
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:39,215
and pop-ups are fallin' for base hits
wherever we look.

1047
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,552
Hold it a second. Now, look -
Did the old man say he ran to the door?

1048
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:45,597
Ran, walked. What's the difference? He got on,
didn't he? I mean, he got there, didn't he?

1049
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:48,224
- No, now wait a second.
- He said he ran. At least I think he did.

1050
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:51,728
Look, I don't remember what he said, but I
don't see how he could have run to the door.

1051
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:54,188
Ηe said he went
from his bedroom to the front door.

1052
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:55,899
- Now, isn't that enough?
- Where was the bedroom?

1053
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,234
- It was down the hall somewhere.
- I thought you remembered everything.

1054
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,570
- Don't you remember that?
- No.

1055
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,864
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see
a diagram of the apartment.

1056
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:06,200
- Why don't we just have 'em run the trial all
over again so you can get everything straight?
- Mr. Foreman.

1057
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,912
How come you're the only one in this room
wants to see exhibits all the time?

1058
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,706
- [ Juror 5 ] I want to see this one too.
- And I'd like to stop wasting time.

1059
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,626
If we're gonna start wading through all that
nonsense about where the body was found -

1060
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,669
[ Juror 8 ] We're not,
not unless somebody else wants to.

1061
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,463
But I'd like to find out if an old man...

1062
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:20,924
who drags one foot when he walks
'cause he had a stroke last year...

1063
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,426
can get from his bedroom
to his front door in 15 seconds.

1064
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,178
- He said 20 seconds.
- Ηe said 15.

1065
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,430
He said 20 seconds.
What are you trying to distort -

1066
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,767
- [ Juror 11 ] He said 15.
- How does he know how long 15 seconds is?

1067
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,518
You can't judge a thing like that.

1068
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,979
[ Juror 9 ] He said 15 seconds.
He was very positive about it.

1069
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:37,273
He was an old man.
Half the time he was confused.

1070
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:39,651
How could he be positive about anything?

1071
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:51,454
I don't see what you're going to prove here.
The man said he saw the boy running out.

1072
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,706
Well, let's see
if the details bear him out.

1073
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,668
As soon as the body hit the floor,
he said he heard footsteps upstairs...

1074
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,419
running toward the front door...

1075
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:01,589
heard the upstairs door open,
the footsteps start down the stairs.

1076
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,800
He said he got to his own front door
as fast as he could...

1077
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,969
and he swore it couldn't have been
more than 15 seconds.

1078
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,720
Now, if the killer
began running immediately -

1079
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:10,014
- [ Juror 12 ] Maybe he didn't.
- The old man said he did.

1080
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:12,809
You ought to be at Atlantic City
at that hairsplitters convention.

1081
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,018
[ Laughing ]

1082
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,229
Hey, why don't you stop makin'
smart remarks all the time, huh?

1083
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,440
My friend, for your three dollars a day,
you have to listen to everything, you know?

1084
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,234
Now that you've got that thing in here,
what about it?

1085
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,486
All right. Here's the apartment
where the killing took place.

1086
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,614
The old man's apartment
was directly beneath and exactly the same.

1087
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:29,909
Here are the el tracks, the bedroom,
living room, kitchen, bathroom.

1088
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:31,995
Here's the hall. Here are the stairs.

It was quite a storm we had there.

I'd like to go over something,
if you gentlemen don't mind.

1330
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:29,706
An important point for the prosecution
was the fact...

1331
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:32,543
that after the boy claimed
he'd been at the movies...

1332
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,628
during the hours
that the killing took place...

1333
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:38,590
couldn't remember the names of the movies
or the stars who appeared in them.

1334

This gentleman here has put up that point
in here several times.

1335
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:42,719
That's correct.

1336
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,680
It was the only alibi the boy offered...

1337
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,266
and he himself couldn't back it up
with any details at all.

1338
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,602
Putting yourself in the boy's place,
do you think you could remember details...

1339
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:54,147
after an upsetting experience such as
being slapped in the face by your father?

1340
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:57,442
I think so, if there were
any special details to remember.

1341
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:00,696
The boy couldn't remember
the names of the movies he saw
because be wasn't there that night.

1342
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,823
According to
the police testimony in court...

1343
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:06,034
the boy was questioned by the detectives
in the kitchen of his apartment...

1344
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:09,037
while the body of his father
was lying on the floor in the bedroom.

1345
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,707
Do you think you could remember details
under those circumstances?

1346
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,792
- I do.
- Under great emotional stress?

1347
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,378
- Under great emotional stress.
- He remembered them correctly in court.

1348
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,422
He named the pictures
and the stars who played in them.

1349
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:21,675
Yes. His lawyer took great pains
to bring that out.

1350
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:24,303
He had three months from the night
of the murder to the day of the trial...

1351
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:26,013
in which to memorize them.

1352
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:28,765
It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out
what played at a particular theater...

1353
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,517
on a particular night.

1354

interrogated the boy right after the murder...

when he couldn't remember
a thing about the movies...

Barbara... Long, I think it was.

1380
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:46,385
A dark, very pretty girl.

1381
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,222

with, uh, unknown -

1384
01:11:58,106 --> 01:12:01,233
And you weren't under
an emotional stress, were you?

1385
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,279
No.

1386
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:08,031
I wasn't.

1387
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,660
I think the point is made.

1388
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,496
Big point!
[ Coughing ]

1389
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,748
You can talk till your tongue
is draggin' on the floor.

1390
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:20,919
The boy is guilty, period.
You know what I mean, my friend?

1391
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:24,256
- Who's got those cough drops?
- They're all gone, my friend.

1392
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,510
Oh, boy. Look at that rain.

1393
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,971
There goes your ball game.

1394
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,473
It's only a shower.

1395
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,726
Besides, they got the infield covered.

1396
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:38,979
Right. Say, could I see that knife
a second, please?

1397
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,109
Well, we're still tied up six to six.

1398
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,194
Who's got a suggestion?

1399
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:48,280
It's five after 6:00.
Let's get some dinner.

1400
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,824
Why don't we wait till 7:00,
give it another hour, huh?

1401
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:53,035
Okay with me.

1402
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:55,287
Uh, there's something I'd like to say.

1403
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:58,915
I mean, it's been bothering me a little,
and as long as we're stuck.

1404
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,878
Well, there was this whole business
about the stab wound and how it was made -

1405
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,588
the downward angle of it, you know?

1406
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:06,673
Don't tell me we're gonna
start with that again.

1407
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:08,383
They've been over it and over it.

1408
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:10,761
Well, I know they did,
but I don't go along with it.

1409
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:14,848
Now, the boy was 5 feet 7 inches tall.
His father was 6'2".

1410
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:17,100
That's a difference of seven inches.

1411
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:19,853
It's a very awkward thing to stab down
into the chest of someone...

1412
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,938
who's more than half a foot
taller than you are.

1413
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,149
Give me that.

1414
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:27,027
I'll give you a demonstration.
Somebody get up.

1415
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,322
You -

1416
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:37,537
I want you to watch this 'cause
I don't want to have to do it again.

1417
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:40,373
I'll make myself about six
or seven inches shorter, okay?

1418
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,585
- It's about right. Maybe a little more.
- Okay. A little more.

1419
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,804
- [ Excited Chattering ]
- [ Juror 6 ] That's not funny.

1420
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:59,726
Now, nobody's hurt. Right?

1421
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:02,187
Right. Nobody hurt.

1422
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:10,445
Now, this is the way I'd stab a man
who was taller than I was.

1423
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,989
Look at the angle - down and in.

1424
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:15,158
And this is the way it was done.

1425
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:17,410
Now tell me I'm wrong.

1426
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:23,041
- Down and in. I guess there's no argument.
- Hold it a minute, will ya?

1427
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:24,960
Can you give me that?

1428
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,879
Boy, I hate these things.

1429
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,631
- Did you ever see a knife fight?
- No.

1430
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,299
- You?
- No.

1431
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,177
- Anybody here ever see a knife fight?
- [ Murmuring ]

1432
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:37,055
Well, I have.
You know, on my back stoop...

1433
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,474
the lot across the street, backyard.

1434
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:41,977
Switchblades came
with the neighborhood where I lived.

1435
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:45,313
It's funny I never thought of it before.
I guess you try to forget those things.

1436
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:48,775
- How do you use a switchblade?
- Well, you'd never use it like this.

1437
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:52,821
See, you use too much time
switching hands.

1438
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:57,075
Here's how - underhanded.

1439
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:02,831
Anyone who's ever used a switch knife
wouldn't handle it any other way.

1440
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:05,542
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

1441
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,460
That's why they're made to open like that.

1442
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:10,172
- You'd say the boy
was pretty handy with a knife?
- Mm-hmm.

1443
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:13,425
You think he could have made
the kind of wound that killed his father?

1444
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:17,429
No. Not with the experience he'd had
all his life handling these things.

1445
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,514
I feel he'd have gone for him underhanded.

1446
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:22,642
How do you know? Were you
in the room when the father was killed?

1447
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,728
No. Neither was anybody else.

1448
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:28,023
So what are you giving us all this
mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.

1449
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:31,359
I don't think you can determine what type of
wound the boy might or might not have made...

1450
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:34,070
simply because he knew
how to handle a knife.

1451
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:36,489
What do you think?

1452
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:38,658
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

1453
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,577
I don't know.

1454
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,791
How about you?

1455
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:50,629
I don't know about the rest of them,
but I'm getting a little tired of this
yackety-yackin' back and forth.

1456
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:54,174
It's gettin' us nowhere.
So I guess I'll have to break it up.

1457
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,801
I change my vote to not guilty.

1458
01:15:56,886 --> 01:16:00,222
- You what?
- You heard me. I've had enough.

1459
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,766
What do you mean you've had enough?
That's no answer!

1460
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:06,811
Hey, listen. You just take care of yourself, huh?
You know?

1461
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:10,857
He's right. That's not an answer.

1462
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:13,902
What kind of a man are you?

1463
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:17,113
You have sat here and voted guilty
with everyone else...

1464
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:21,451
because there are some baseball tickets
burning a hole in your pocket.

1465
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:25,789
And now you've changed your vote because
you say you're sick of all the talking here?

1466
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:28,250
Now listen, buddy!

1467
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:33,004
Who tells you that you have the right
to play like this with a man's life?

1468
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:35,590
- Don't you care -
- Now wait a minute!

1469
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:39,678
- You can't talk like that to me!
- I can talk like that to you.

1470
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:41,638
If you want to vote not guilty...

1471
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:44,099
then do it because you are convinced
the man is not guilty...

1472
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:45,976
not because you've had enough.

1473
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,645
And if you think he is guilty,
then vote that way.

1474
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:51,940
Or don't you have the guts
to do what you think is right?

1475
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,276
- Now listen.
- Guilty or not guilty?

1476
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:58,655
- I told you, not guilty.
- Why?

1477
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:01,950
Look, I don't have to -

1478
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,161
You do have to! Say it! Why?

1479
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:07,706
All right. I don't, uh, think he's guilty.

1480
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:18,842
I want another vote.

1481
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:21,428
[ Foreman ]
Okay. There's another vote called for.

1482
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:24,389
I guess the quickest way is a show of hands.
Anyone object?

1483
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,392
Okay. All those voting not guilty,
raise your hands.

1484
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:33,481
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

1485
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:37,986
eight.

1486
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:44,034
Um, nine.

1487
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:50,040
Um, all those voting guilty,
raise your hands.

1488
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:52,500
One, two, three.

1489
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:55,086
Well, the vote's nine to three
in favor of acquittal.

1490
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:58,256
I don't understand you people!

1491
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:00,508
I mean, all these picky little points
you keep bringing up.

1492
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:03,928
They don't mean nothing!
You saw this kid just like I did.

1493
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:07,515
You're not gonna tell me you believe
that phony story about losing the knife...

1494
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,601
and that business
about being at the movies.

1495
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,687
Look, you know how these people lie.
It's born in them.

1496
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:14,814
I mean, what the heck.
I don't have to tell you.

1497
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,858
They don't know what the truth is.

1498
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:20,653
And let me tell you, they don't need
any real big reason to kill someone either.

1499
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,489
No, sir.

1500
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:25,617
They get drunk!
Oh, they're real big drinkers, all of 'em.

1501
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,870
You know that.
And bang - someone's lying in the gutter.

1502
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,956
Well, nobody's blaming them for it.
That's the way they are, by nature.

1503
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,125
You know what I mean? Violent!

1504
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,710
Where are you going?

1505
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:38,797
Ηuman life don't mean
as much to them as it does to us.

1506
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:42,801
Look! They're lushing it up
and fighting all the time...

1507
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:44,886
and if somebody gets killed,
so somebody gets killed!

1508
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,346
They don't care!

1509
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,640
Oh, sure, there's some good things
about 'em too.

1510
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,683
Look, I'm the first one to say that.

1511
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:54,062
I've known a couple who were okay,
but that's the exception, you know what I mean?

1512
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:57,899
Most of 'em, it's like they have no feelings.
They can do anything.

1513
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,568
What's going on here?

1514
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,695
I'm - I'm trying to tell ya...

1515
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,781
you're making a big mistake, you people.

1516
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:07,867
This kid is a liar!
I know it. I know all about them.

1517
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,746
Listen to me.
They're no good.

1518
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:14,165
There's not a one of 'em who's any good.

1519
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,670
I mean, what -
What's happening in here?

1520
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,005
I'm speaking my piece, and you -

1521
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:23,883
Listen to me.

1522
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:26,428
I -

1523
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:28,972
We're - This kid on trial here, his type -

1524
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:31,057
Well, don't you know about them?

1525
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:36,479
Th-There's - There's a danger here.

1526
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:38,648
These people are dangerous.

1527
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:41,776
They're... wild.

1528
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:43,778
Listen to me.

1529
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,197
- Listen.
- I have.

1530
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:49,284
Now sit down
and don't open your mouth again.

1531
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:55,957
I was only trying to... tell you.

1532
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:36,748
It's always difficult to keep personal prejudice
out of a thing like this.

1533
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:41,878
Wherever you run into it,
prejudice always obscures the truth.

1534
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:45,840
I don't really know what the truth is.

1535
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:48,843
I don't suppose anybody
will ever really know.

1536
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:54,098
Nine of us now seem to feel
that the defendant is innocent.

1537
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:57,185
But we're just gambling on probabilities.

1538
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,229
We may be wrong.

1539
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:01,689
We may be trying to let
a guilty man go free.

1540
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,233
I don't know.

1541
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,318
Nobody really can.

1542
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:07,779
But we have a reasonable doubt...

1543
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:11,366
and that's something
that's very valuable in our system.

1544
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:15,995
No jury can declare a man guilty
unless it's sure.

1545
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:19,832
We nine can't understand...

1546
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:22,627
how you three are still so sure.

1547
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:25,463
- Maybe you can tell us.
- I'll try.

1548
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,343
You've made some excellent points,
but I still believe the boy is guilty of murder...

1549
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:32,136
and I have two reasons.

1550
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:35,348
One, the evidence
given by the woman across the street...

1551
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:38,059
who actually saw the murder committed.

1552
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,728
As far as I'm concerned,
that's the most important testimony.

1553
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:44,065
And two, the fact that she
described the stabbing by saying...

1554
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:49,779
she saw the boy raise his arm over his head
and stab down into the father's chest.

1555
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,906
She saw him do it the wrong way.

1556
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:53,908
That's absolutely right.

1557
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:56,578
Let's talk about this woman for a moment.

1558
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,747
She said she went to bed
about 11:00 that night.

1559
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:03,418
Her bed was next to the window,
and she could look out while lying down...

1560
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:07,589
and see directly into the boy's room
across the street.

1561
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:10,300
She tossed and turned for over an hour,
unable to sleep.

1562
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:14,554
Finally, she turned toward the window
at about 10 minutes after 12:00...

1563
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:19,767
and, as she looked out, she saw the killing
through the windows of a passing el train.

1564
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:22,562
She said the lights went out
immediately after the killing...

1565
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:27,442
but that she got a good look at the boy
in the act of stabbing his father.

1566
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:32,280
As far as I can see it,
this is unshakable testimony.

1567
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,700
- Well, that's the whole case.
- What do you think?

1568
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,749
How about you?

1569
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,836
I-I don't know.

1570
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,921
So much evidence to sift.

1571
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,965
This is a pretty complicated business.

1572
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:54,844
Frankly, I don't see
how you can vote for acquittal.

1573
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:57,263
It's not so easy to arrange
all the evidence in order.

1574
01:22:57,348 --> 01:22:59,390
[ Juror 3 ] You can throw out
all the other evidence!

1575
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:03,061
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

1576
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,021
- Yeah, well, maybe -
- Let's vote on it.

1577
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:07,273
[ Foreman ]
Okay. There's another vote called for.

1578
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:09,192
Anybody object?

1579
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:12,320
All right. I'm changing my vote.
He's guilty.

1580
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,822
Anybody else?
The vote is eight to four.

1581
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:18,493
Why is this such a personal triumph
for you - this one vote?

1582
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:22,038
Okay. I say we're a hung jury.
I say we take it in to the judge.

1583
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,832
Ηow about it?
I want to hear arguments.

1584
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:27,418
You, you're the leader of the cause.
What about it?

1585
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:31,506
Let's go over it again.

1586
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,508
We've been over it again!

1587
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:38,388
The boy in the gray flannel suit here is bouncin'
backwards and forwards like a tennis ball.

1588
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:42,308
No point in getting nasty
and trying to turn this into a contest.

1589
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:45,728
Okay.

1590
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:48,856
Maybe we can talk about
setting some kind of time limit.

1591
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,067
Yeah, once around for the deal, huh?

1592
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:55,530
It's a quarter after 6:00.

1593
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:57,573
Someone before mentioned 7:00.

1594
01:23:57,658 --> 01:24:00,034
I think that's a point at which
we might begin to discuss...

1595
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:03,371
the question of whether
we're a hung jury or not.

1596
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,123
Don't you feel well?

1597
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,418
I feel perfectly well, thank you.

1598
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:11,212
I was saying that 7:00
would be a reasonable time.

1599
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:14,215
Uh, the reason I asked about that
was because, uh...

1600
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:15,883
you were rubbing your nose like -

1601
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:18,636
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting...

1602
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:21,931
but you made a gesture
that reminded me of something.

1603
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:24,058
I'm trying to settle something here.
Do you mind?

1604
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:26,144
Well, I think this is important.

1605
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:29,021
Thank you.

1606
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:31,733
Now then,
I'm sure you'll pardon me for this...

1607
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,736
but I was wondering why
you were rubbing your nose like that.

1608
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,487
[ Juror 3 ]
Oh, come on, will ya?

1609
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:40,742
At this point, I happen to be talking
to the gentleman sitting next to you!

1610
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:44,078
Now, why were you rubbing
your nose like that?

1611
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:48,249
Well, if it's any of your business,
I was rubbing it because it bothers me a little.

1612
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:49,959
Oh. I'm sorry.

1613
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:53,921
- Is it - Is it because of your eyeglasses?
- It is.

1614
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:55,757
Now can we get on to something else?

1615
01:24:55,841 --> 01:25:00,428
Your eyeglasses made those two
deep impressions on the sides of your nose.

1616
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,680
I hadn't noticed that before.

1617
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:06,267
- That must be annoying.
- It is very annoying.

1618
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,269
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

1619
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:11,689
I've never worn eyeglasses.
Twenty-twenty.

1620
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:14,317
Listen, will you come on already
with the optometrist bit?

1621
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:19,781
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing...

1622
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:23,409
had those same marks
on the sides of her nose.

1623
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:26,621
[ Juror 6 ]
Holy smokes! You know, he's right.

1624
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,372
- [ All Chattering ]
- [ Juror 9 ] Please.

1625
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:32,210
Just give me a minute,
and I'll be finished.

1626
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:35,129
I don't know if anyone else
noticed that about her.

1627
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:39,091
I didn't think of it then,
but I've been going over her face...

1628
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,261
in my mind.

1629
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:44,347
She had those same marks.

1630
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:49,519
- She kept rubbing them in court.
- He's right. She did do that a lot.

1631
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:55,233
This woman was about, uh -
about 45 years old.

1632
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:59,278
She was making a tremendous effort
to look 35...

1633
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:01,572
for her first public appearance.

1634
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:04,909
Heavy makeup, dyed hair...

1635
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:08,871
brand-new clothes that should have
been worn by a younger woman.

1636
01:26:08,956 --> 01:26:10,623
No glasses.

1637
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,375
No, women do that.

1638
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:14,877
See if you can get the mental picture of it.

1639
01:26:14,962 --> 01:26:16,796
What do you mean, no glasses?

1640
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,590
How do you know whether she wore glasses?
Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?

1641
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,884
Now, she had those marks. I saw 'em.

1642
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:23,886
So what?
What do ya think that means?

1643
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:27,181
- Listen, I'm getting so sick
of your yelling in here!
- Come on. Forget it.

1644
01:26:27,266 --> 01:26:30,268
Hey, listen. Listen, he's right.
I saw them too.

1645
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:33,479
I was the closest one to her. She had these, uh -
these things on the side of her nose.

1646
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:36,774
- What do you call those on the side?
- Well, what point are you making here?

1647
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:40,736
She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.
Well, what does that mean?

1648
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:45,116
Could those marks be made
by anything other than eyeglasses?

1649
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:51,038
No, they couldn't.

1650
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:53,124
[ Juror 3 ]
I didn't see any marks!

1651
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:56,460
I did.

1652
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:59,088
Strange, but I didn't think about it before.

1653
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:01,299
Well, what about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say something?

1654
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:04,302
There are 12 people in here
concentrating on this case.

1655
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:06,470
Eleven of us didn't think of it either.

1656
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:09,724
Well, what about the district attorney?
Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?

1657
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,684
Have her testify without her glasses?

1658
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:15,730
Did you ever see a woman
who had to wear glasses and didn't want to
because she thinks they spoil her looks?

1659
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:19,317
Okay. She had marks on her nose.

1660
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:23,070
I'm giving you that.
From glasses, right?

1661
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:27,325
She didn't want to wear 'em out of the house
so people would think she's gorgeous.

1662
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:31,996
But when she saw this kid killing his father,
she was in the house alone.

1663
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,290
That's all.

1664
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:38,377
- Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?
- No, I don't.

1665
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:42,006
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.

1666
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,092
It's logical to assume that she wasn't
wearing them when she was in bed...

1667
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:46,928
tossing and turning, trying to fall asleep.

1668
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:49,347
- How do you know?
- I don't know! I'm guessing.

1669
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:51,891
I'm also guessing that she probably
didn't put her glasses on...

1670
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:54,101
when she turned
to look casually out of the window.

1671
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,938
And she herself testified the killing
took place just as she looked out.

1672
01:27:57,022 --> 01:28:00,066
The lights went off a split second later.
She couldn't have had time to put them on then.

1673
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:01,776
- Wait a second.
- Here's another guess.

1674
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:05,947
Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy
kill his father. I say she only saw a blur.

1675
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:09,617
How do you know what she saw?
How does he know all that?

Maybe they were sunglasses.

Maybe she was farsighted.
What do you know about it?

is in question now.

60 feet away, at night, without glasses.
